              Fellisse, a psychic for hire, is visited by several clients in her office. Her services are mainly the treatment of psychological traumas or the curing of phobias through the process of entering her client’s mind by detaching herself from her body and assuming a spiritual form. Once inside the psyche, the environment that results embodies the trauma or fears of the host, as such the surroundings tend to be rather hostile in turn. Her ultimate goal is to traverse the client’s mind space and locate their Anguish Nucleus and return to the material world.

              Once the Anguish Nucleus is seized, the environment will begin to collapse since the trauma has been removed from its center. So Fellisse needs to escape before she is destroyed alongside the trauma of her client. Once outside, depending on the difficulty of the retrieval, she charges the client accordingly and assures them that their trauma will not bother them anymore.

              The gameplay revolves around exploring the environment and scouring for objects that may be useful during the traversal. Blockades will often occur at parts which must be cleared through puzzles, that when solved will show the way forward. All leading up until reaching the core of the environment, which must once again be solved in order to bring the case to a close.
