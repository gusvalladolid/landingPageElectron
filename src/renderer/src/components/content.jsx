              Fellisse, a psychic for hire, is visited by several clients in her office. Her services are mainly the treatment of psychological traumas or the curing of phobias through the process of entering her client’s mind by detaching herself from her body and assuming a spiritual form. Once inside the psyche, the environment that results embodies the trauma or fears of the host, as such the surroundings tend to be rather hostile in turn. Her ultimate goal is to traverse the client’s mind space and locate their Anguish Nucleus and return to the material world.

              Once the Anguish Nucleus is seized, the environment will begin to collapse since the trauma has been removed from its center. So Fellisse needs to escape before she is destroyed alongside the trauma of her client. Once outside, depending on the difficulty of the retrieval, she charges the client accordingly and assures them that their trauma will not bother them anymore.

              The gameplay revolves around exploring the environment and scouring for objects that may be useful during the traversal. Blockades will often occur at parts which must be cleared through puzzles, that when solved will show the way forward. All leading up until reaching the core of the environment, which must once again be solved in order to bring the case to a close.

              <p className="mt-6">
                The soundtrack in the game features original compositions from the development
                team’s sound specialist. The sounds featured in the game are guaranteed to instill unease
                and fear into your heart, as you delve into the deepest recesses of the mind’s darkness.
                A warning is also fair when sound can put you in the highest level of alert, so it is
                recommended to play with headphones and at a level where you can enjoy the ambiance
                while also making sure no loud noises frighten you terribly.
                <em> (Warning: This is a horror game, as such loud sounds are part of the experience. It is
                recommended from those suffering from certain conditions that increase their sensitivity
                to loud noises to take precautionary measures as to ensure their integrity.)</em>

              <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-red-800">Advanced Puzzle Solving.</h2>
              <p className="mt-6">
              Progression is marked by solving several puzzles that can be found in the mental
              environment. During testing, these puzzles have proven to take some time to complete.
              So while the puzzles test your wit, the terrors will test your grit. All that can be said is to
              take one’s time solving the puzzles and enjoy figuring them out. While terrors do await
              in this experience, there is no need for it to not be fun.
              Some puzzles may be familiar while others aren’t. Enjoy the first experience, for you
              can only experience it for the first time once.

              <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-red-800">Environme Exploration.</h2>
              <p className="mt-6">
              Explore unique environments, molded by the characters’ traumas and fear. Brave the
              horrors that your clients couldn’t in an effort to spare them of their torment. Ranging
              from the ventilation system of a building that is infested with insects, to a hospital that
              encompasses the horrors that can occur in places where life is meant to be saved.
              Each character brings their horror to Fellise’s table and it is up to you to help her
              navigate safely and fulfill her end of the deal.
              </p>
              <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-red-800">Horrors of the mind.</h2>
              <p className="mt-6">
              Claustrophobia, entomophobia, hemophobia, to name a few. Fear is something that can
              be labeled, as not everybody is afraid of the same thing. But what is true, is that while
              someone may not be scared by these, for instance, they are at unease, uncomfortable
              with what they’re doing. That is the goal of this experience, that no matter if you’re
              afraid or not, the game will find a way to crawl under your skin and make you feel its
              horrors.
